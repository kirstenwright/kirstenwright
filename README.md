### :sparkles:âš¡Fun Factsâš¡:sparkles:

####    :dog: My dog Lillie is indisputably the best, goodest dog in the world.
####   :cat: :guitar:   I have an ultra-friendly cat named Jack (short for Jack White, in honor of my decade-long crush).
####    :snake:  Snake Lively is the name of my ball python -- I call her Snakey, for short. 
####   :beers: I love to kick back with a hazy IPA; I am also, likely, the biggest pumpkin beer fan on our planet. Yes, this is controversial. 
####  :pizza:   While we're on the topic of food controversies, I am staunchly pro-pineapple pizza.
####   :soccer:   I love soccer and running. I ran the 1500m back in the day and the smell of a rubber track still makes my heart race.  
####  :book:  I love to write, edit, and read, and I especially :heart: Walt Whitman.
####  :musical_score:  I am a classically trained pianist with relative pitch and pseudo-absolute (perfect) pitch<sup>1</sup>. This means I can immediately play anything I hear. It makes for a great party trick!
